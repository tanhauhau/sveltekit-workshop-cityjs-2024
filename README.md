# Advanced Svelte Workshop: Building a real-world app in Svelte and SvelteKit.

A step-by-step workshop to build a photo album in SvelteKit, all while learning Svelte and SvelteKit fundamentals.

## Pre-Workshop Instructions

In order to maximize our time _during_ the workshop, please complete the following tasks in advance:

- [ ] Set up the project (follow the [setup instructions](#system-requirements) below)
- [ ] Install and run [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) on the computer you'll be developing with
- [ ] Set up dual monitors for live coding, if possible
- [ ] Install a code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ ] Brush up on [modern ES.next features](https://javascript.info), if they are unfamiliar to you
- [ ] Have experience building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript DOM APIs

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you! üëç

### System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) v8 or higher

All of these must also be available in your `PATH` in order to be run globally. To verify things are set up properly, run:

```sh
git --version
node --version
pnpm --version
```

If you have a lower version of node installed, and do not wish to upgrade your node version, you can [install `nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage multiple versions of node.

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the `PATH` environment variable and how to fix it here for [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/) or [Mac/Linux](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24322978/971592).

### Code Editor

The recommended code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To make sure you have the best development experience, do install:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Svelte for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)
